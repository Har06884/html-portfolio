  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>Welcome to my portfolio website, showcasing what web project work I have created. My day job is a Colege Computing Lecturer, 
    teaching learners from a Level 1 to Level 5. I teach a range of computing topics across all the levels.</p>

  <p>My main skill is with programming, starting from a young age, I learnt to program using Basic, then QBasic, before moving onto other languages.
    I started learning Pascal when i started college, before learning Visual Basic, Java and C++. Adding to my skill set was Python which I learnt and taught
    during my PGCE. While teaching HE learners on HND i learnt alonmg side the class Visual C#. Completing my Masters i have gained experience using SQL, R and
    more advanced programming knowledge using Python.
  </p>

  <p>One of the area's I enjoy teahcing is Web Development, which I do with the Level 1, and Level 2 learners. I also support our learners that take part in the
    World Skill Competition at the Welsh level with Web Development, allowing the opportunity to help develop the base skills with Level 3 learners.
    I am taking part in this course to further my own knowledge with Web Development so that I can further aid those taking part in competitions, as well as
    further continuing my own development in the ever change world of Web Developmehnt.
